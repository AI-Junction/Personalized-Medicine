        "\n",
        "Here, the objective is to develop ML models capable of classifying mixed patterns of proteins in microscope images. The Human Protein Atlas will use these models to build a tool integrated with their smart-microscopy system to identify a protein's location(s) from a high-throughput image. Proteins are “the doers” in the human cell, executing many functions that together enable life. In order to fully understand the complexity of the human cell, models must classify mixed patterns of proteins across a range of different human cells.\n",
        "\n",
        "Images visualizing proteins in cells are commonly used for biomedical research, and these cells could hold the key for the next breakthrough in medicine. However, thanks to advances in high-throughput microscopy, these images are generated at a far greater pace than what can be manually evaluated. Therefore, the need is greater than ever for automating biomedical image analysis to accelerate the understanding of human cells and disease.\n",
        "\n",
        "Again, the goal here is to predict various protein structures in cellular images. There are 28 different target proteins. Multiple proteins can be present in one image (multilabel classification)"
